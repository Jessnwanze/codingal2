    <h1>Electrical current</h1>

    <p><small>electrical current can be defined as the flow of charged particles such as electron or ions,moving through an electric conductor,it is measured in Amperes</small> </p>
    it is one of the most imporant part of electricity

    <h2>potential difference</h2>

    <p><small>this is the difference of electrical potential between two points.it is measured in coulombs per charge.</small></p>

    <h3>Electrical resistance</h3>

    <p><small>this is a measure of the opposition to the flow of current in an electrical circuit or it is the opposition that a substance offers to the flow of electric circuit and it is mesured in voltage</small></p>
